- GUI programming support -> used for desktop applications
- integretted -> with other languages
- dynamic memory allocation-> allocates memory at runtime -> by defsult takes data as string

## VARIABLES IN PYTHON
- we dont need to specify type of variable

- b="hello"
- c=a // assigning a variable value to c
- Types of cases-
    - camelCase -> no spaces -> first capital 
    - PascalCase
    - Snake_Case
- Multiple assign
    - a=b=c=20
    - a,b,c=10,20,30
- LOcal variable 
    - a=int(input())
    -   print(a)
    - function call-> add()
- Global variable -> can be used inside and outside function( which wasn't possible in c)
