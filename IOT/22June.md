# 2D ARRAY 
- ROWS AND COLUMNS ke form me 
- used to hold bulk of data and can be passed to functions whenever required
- ex- attendance register (2d array)
- in 2d array int a [],[]

# POINTERS 
- size of pointer depends on architecture
- stores address to a variable 
- int *p=&a;
- printf("%x",p);  ---> printing hexadecimal value i.e address
- printf("%d",*p); --> print value of variable to which it is pointing to 
- improves performance as directly from memory 
- DYNAMIC ALLOCATION OF MEMORY - by malloc(), calloc() where pointer is used (stdlib.h)
- array function structure -> reduces code and improve performance 

# CALL BY VALUE 
-> by value normal value passed by function 
# CALL BY REFERNCE 
-> by passing address -> less time
